.SYNOPSIS
    Stop a VM, restore a named checkpoint, and start it again.

.DESCRIPTION
    Tiny wrapper around Stop-VM / Restore-VMCheckpoint / Start-VM used by
    lab/run-scenario.sh to cycle samba-dc1 back to its 'golden-image'
    checkpoint between test runs. Deliberately does no waiting - the caller
    polls SSH on the VM's IP to determine readiness.

.PARAMETER VMName
    VM to revert. Required.
.PARAMETER Checkpoint
    Checkpoint name to restore. Default 'golden-image'.
